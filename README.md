### 1. Overview

In this project, I'm exploring the analysis of predicting product sales based on TV, Radio and Newspaper advertisements using a multilayer perceptron model. The model training loss is computed using **mean_squared_error**.




### 2. Requirements

- Python 3
- Pandas
- Numpy
- sklearn
- keras
- seaborn
- matplotlib



### 3. Conclusion

The model design has 4 neural layes and trained on **1000 epoch** and evaluated on the **mean_absolute_error and mean_squared_error** metrics respectively.
